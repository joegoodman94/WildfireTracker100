Observed fire patterns suggest that burned area is sensitive to change in FWI below ~17, but insensitive to changes in FWI above this threshold. Hence boreal forests and tropical forests are identified as sensitive to changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind speed. Increases in burned area are modelled in these sensitive biomes for the period 2026–2045.",

The models indicate an increase in maximum annual fire danger from 1971-2000 to 2071-2100 according to the Nesterov Index, which incorporates temperature and days since precipitation. Climate drivers alone contribute to an increase in burned area, while humans suppress fires globally but with notable regional variability.",

    "title":"Climate change increases the potential for extreme wildfires",
    "journal":"Geophysical Research Letters",
    "summary":"This paper identifies that the occurrence of extreme wildfires is more likely when lower tropospheric instability and dryness, measured by the C-Haines index, promote fire escalation. These conditions are mostly observed in Australian summer, however, future projections indicate their increasing likelihood in November, and to a lesser degree in December, lengthening the wildfire window and overall likelihood. In addition these conditions are linked with rugged topography more than flat plains.",

    "summary":"Using climate projections, historical weather observations, active fire detections, and a national fire database, this study evaluated how the frequency of fire 'spread days’, which correspond to hot, dry, and windy conditions, will change with climate. Results suggest that climate change over the next century will increase spread days in almost all Canadian forest regions, by 200-300% in eastern Canada and 50% in western Canada under a high CO2 forcing scenario (RCP8.5).",

Rising wildfire activity is linked to earlier spring snowmelt and longer/more intense periods of moisture deficit in spring and summer. Areas where the historical mean snow-free season ranged between two and four months, and with relatively high cumulative warm-season evapotranspiration, have been most affected.",

Significantly increased atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (PVD) results in an exponential increase in forest-fire area burned. In fall wild fires are promoted by wind effects and delayed arrival of winter rains. \"Warming driven fuel drying is the clearest link between anthropogenic climate change and California wildfire activity\".",
